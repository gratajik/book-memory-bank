# AI Image Generation Prompts for Book Covers

This document provides templates and examples for creating effective prompts for AI image generators (like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion) to produce compelling book cover options.

## Technical Specifications

For optimal KDP cover requirements:
- Recommended dimensions: 2560 x 1600 pixels
- Minimum: 1000 x 625 pixels
- Aspect ratio: 1.6:1
- Format: RGB color space, JPEG or TIFF
- Leave space at top and bottom for title and author name

## Prompt Structure

Effective AI image prompts for book covers generally follow this structure:

```
Professional book cover, [style descriptor], [main subject/focal point], [setting/background], [lighting], [mood/atmosphere], [artistic style], [composition notes]. Title area at top, author area at bottom. [Genre] aesthetic like [reference work]. [Technical quality descriptors], [special effects].
```

## Core Elements to Include

1. **Professional context**: Always start with "Professional book cover" to set context
2. **Main focal element**: The central visual that captures the book's essence
3. **Mood/atmosphere**: The emotional tone the cover should convey
4. **Composition**: How elements are arranged, including space for text
5. **Genre signifiers**: Visual elements that signal the book's genre
6. **Quality descriptors**: Terms like "hyper-realistic," "detailed," etc.
7. **Reference works**: Comparisons to known works in your genre

## Example Prompt Templates

### Character-Focused Cover

```

Somber/tense/mysterious mood with [color scheme] palette. Ultra-detailed, [artistic style] with [special effect]. Title area at top, author area at bottom. [Genre] aesthetic like [reference work]. Hyper-realistic, 8K, volumetric lighting.
```

### Setting-Focused Cover

```
Professional book cover, atmospheric, [location/setting description] with [distinctive feature]. [Weather/time of day] creating [mood] atmosphere. [Small detail or character] providing scale. [Color scheme] with [accent color] highlights. Title area at top, author area at bottom. [Genre] aesthetic like [reference work]. Ultra-detailed, [artistic style], cinematic composition.
```

### Symbolic/Conceptual Cover

```
Professional book cover, minimalist/abstract, [symbolic object] against [simple background]. The [object] appears [distinctive quality] suggesting [theme]. [Color scheme] creating [mood] atmosphere. Clean negative space for title and author. [Genre] aesthetic like [reference work]. Sharp vector-like quality, perfect for book cover.
```

### Typography-Focused Cover

```
Professional book cover, typography-focused, the word "[TITLE]" in large [style] letters that [distinctive quality]. Behind the text is [subtle background element]. [Color scheme] with [accent color] highlights. Author name area at bottom. [Genre] aesthetic like [reference work]. High-contrast, visually striking, designed for thumbnail visibility.
```

## Modification Keywords

Add these keywords to modify the style of any prompt:

- **More dramatic**: "dramatic lighting, high contrast, chiaroscuro effect, stark shadows"
- **More ethereal**: "dreamlike quality, soft focus, ethereal lighting, translucent elements"
- **More ominous**: "foreboding atmosphere, dark shadows, muted colors, threatening elements"
- **More commercial**: "mainstream aesthetic, commercial book cover style, bestseller appearance"
- **More literary**: "subtle symbolism, understated elegance, literary fiction sensibility"
- **More dynamic**: "sense of motion, dynamic composition, action-oriented, energetic feel"

## Genre-Specific Element Suggestions

### Science Fiction
- Advanced technology, spacecraft, futuristic cityscapes
- Holographic elements, digital interfaces
- Planetary bodies, stars, nebulae
- Clean lines, metallic surfaces

### Fantasy
- Magical elements, mystical symbols
- Ancient architecture, castles, ruins
- Fantastical creatures, enchanted objects
- Rich textures, ornate details

### Horror
- Shadowy figures, partial faces
- Abandoned locations, decrepit structures
- Uncanny elements, subtle wrongness

- Soft lighting, warm colors
- Elegant typography, delicate details

## Title Treatment Suggestions

- **Size**: Large enough to read at thumbnail size
- **Position**: Typically top third (or center for emphasis)
- **Font Choice**: Should match genre expectations
- **Effects**: Consider subtle effects that match the book's theme
- **Contrast**: Must stand out against the background

## AI Platform Specific Tips

### Midjourney
- Use --stylize parameter to control artistic interpretation
- Add --aspect 1.6:1 for proper KDP ratio
- Use --quality parameter for higher detail
- Consider --chaos parameter for more varied outputs

### DALL-E
- Be extremely specific about composition
- Specify "book cover composition with title space"
- Request "digital art" or "photorealistic" depending on need
- Add "8K, highly detailed" for best results

### Stable Diffusion
- Use negative prompts to avoid unwanted elements
- Specify steps (50+) for more detailed results
- Experiment with different samplers for different styles
- Add "masterpiece, best quality" for better outcomes

## Example Cover Prompts (Based on "DERELICT")

### Example 1: The Harbinger Ship

```
Professional book cover, cinematic, a massive skeletal hand-shaped alien spacecraft silhouetted against a distant amber nebula, stark against the void of space. The vessel is ancient, partially decayed, with deep matte black material that seems to absorb light. Tiny human spacecraft approaching it for scale. Desolate, foreboding atmosphere. Ultradetailed, haunting, deep shadows, eerie blue accent lighting along spacecraft contours. Title area at top, author area at bottom. Sci-fi horror aesthetic like Event Horizon. Hyper-realistic, 8K, volumetric lighting.
```

### Example 2: SENTINEL Interface

```
Professional book cover, cinematic, looking through a fractured blue holographic interface covered in alien glyphs and percentage calculations. Beyond the interface is a dark corridor of an alien ship with organic-mechanical components that resemble a ribcage. A single human silhouette stands alone in the distance. Cold blue lighting with red warning indicators. Ultradetailed, sinister atmosphere, data visualization elements. Title area at top, author area at bottom. Sci-fi horror aesthetic like Alien. Hyper-realistic, 8K, volumetric lighting.
```

### Example 3: Integration Chamber

```
Professional book cover, cinematic, a high-tech alien chamber with a central pod/capsule that's part mechanical, part organic. The pod has neural interface cables suspended from above. Eerie blue light emanates from within the pod. Dark metallic surfaces reflecting minimal light. The chamber has strange symbols etched into walls. Ultradetailed, ominous atmosphere, cold sterile environment with shadows. Title area at top, author area at bottom. Sci-fi horror aesthetic like Prometheus. Hyper-realistic, 8K, volumetric lighting.
```

### Example 4: Minimalist Approach

```
Professional book cover, minimalist, a single glowing blue neural interface implant against absolute black. The implant has circuit-like patterns extending outward like corruption spreading. Clean, high-contrast design with extreme negative space. Small silhouette of a hand-shaped spacecraft barely visible within the blue glow. Elegant, unsettling simplicity. Title area at top (large), author area at bottom. Contemporary sci-fi aesthetic like Ex Machina. Sharp vector-like quality, perfect for book cover.
```

## Additional Tips

1. Generate multiple variations of your preferred prompt
2. Pay special attention to text placement areas - leave appropriate negative space
3. Check the cover at thumbnail size to ensure readability
4. Ensure your final image meets the technical requirements for your publishing platform
5. Consider creating a series of consistent covers if planning multiple books
