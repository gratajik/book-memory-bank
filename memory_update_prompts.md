This document provides ready-to-use prompts that instruct Cline to automatically update your Book Memory Bank without requiring any scripts or manual file management. Simply copy and use these prompts at the appropriate time in your writing process.

## Automatic Content Analysis Prompts

### After Completing a Chapter

```
I've just completed Chapter [X]: [Chapter Title]. 

Please:
1. Read the entire chapter content
2. Identify all new information about characters, world elements, and plot developments
3. Automatically update all relevant memory bank files
4. Provide a summary of the updates you've made

Make sure to check for:
- New or modified character traits, relationships, and motivations
- New locations, objects, or world-building elements
- Plot developments, including foreshadowing and setup for future events
- Changes to character arcs or motivations
- Updates to the overall completion percentage

Use your file access capabilities to directly update the memory bank files without requiring me to run any scripts or copy/paste information.
```

### After Completing a Chapter Outline

```
I've just completed the outline for Chapter [X]: [Chapter Title].

Please:
1. Read the entire outline
2. Identify planned story elements, characters, and world-building components
3. Update all relevant memory bank files with this planned information
4. Mark these elements as "planned" (vs. "established") where appropriate
5. Provide a summary of the updates you've made

Pay special attention to:
- New characters being introduced
- New locations or settings to be featured

- Setup elements that will need future payoffs
- Foreshadowing elements being planted

Keep track of these planned elements in the memory bank so we maintain consistency as we write the actual chapter.
```

### For Specific Story Elements

```
We've established important new information about [element type] in our recent work.

Please update the memory bank with these details about [specific element]:
[List key details or just mention the element and have Cline analyze]

Use your file access to:
1. Read the relevant memory bank files
2. Determine where these updates should be placed
3. Update the files directly using write_to_file or replace_in_file
4. Confirm what changes were made

Focus particularly on updating [relevant file, e.g., Characters/character_profiles.md, Core/worldContext.md, etc.]

## Best Practices for Using These Prompts

1. **Be specific** when possible about what elements need updating
2. **Provide context** about where new information was established
3. **Review summaries** that Cline provides about the updates made
4. **Schedule regular audits** to ensure ongoing memory bank health
5. **Use prompt combinations** for complex update scenarios

Remember that Cline can directly update files without requiring you to run scripts or manually copy information. These prompts leverage that capability to keep your memory bank current with minimal effort.
