# Memory Bank Auto-Update: Quick Start Guide

This guide explains how to use Cline's built-in capabilities to automatically update your book memory bank with minimal user effort, ensuring ALL relevant files are updated.

## Direct Conversational Updates

The simplest way to update your memory bank is through conversation with Cline:

1. **Complete a chapter or outline**
2. **Tell Cline**: "I've just completed Chapter 5: The Revelation. Please perform a COMPREHENSIVE memory bank update."
3. **Wait**: Cline will analyze the chapter and update ALL relevant memory bank files

No scripts, no manual extraction, no file manipulation required - just ask Cline directly.

## How It Works

When you request a memory bank update, Cline performs these steps automatically:

1. **Content Analysis**: Read the chapter or outline and identify new information
2. **Context Comparison**: Compare with existing memory bank information
3. **Interdependency Mapping**: Identify ALL files that could be affected by new information
4. **File Updates**: Make targeted changes to ALL appropriate files
5. **Update Summary**: Provide a report of all changes made across ALL files

## Example Update Prompts for Comprehensive Updates

### For Completed Chapters:
```
I've just completed Chapter 5: The Revelation. 

Please perform a COMPREHENSIVE memory bank update:
1. Read the entire chapter content
2. Identify ALL new information about characters, world elements, plot developments, themes, and style
3. Check and update EVERY relevant memory bank file
4. Update character_profiles.md, worldContext.md, master_outline.md, narrativePatterns.md, AND activeContext.md
5. Provide a detailed summary of ALL updates made to EACH file
```

### For Chapter Outlines:
```
I've just completed the outline for Chapter 5: The Revelation.

Please perform a COMPLETE memory bank update:
1. Read the entire outline
2. Identify ALL planned story elements, characters, and world-building components
3. Update EVERY relevant memory bank file with this planned information
4. Ensure updates to character_profiles.md, worldContext.md, master_outline.md, AND activeContext.md
5. Mark these elements as "planned" (vs. "established") where appropriate
6. Provide a complete list of ALL files updated and changes made
```

### For Consistency Checks:
```
Please perform a comprehensive memory bank consistency check.

1. Review ALL memory bank files for internal consistency
2. Check for contradictions between ALL different memory bank files
3. Verify that character arcs align with plot developments
4. Confirm worldbuilding elements are consistent across ALL files
5. Ensure activeContext.md accurately reflects the current state of ALL elements
```

## Ensuring ALL Files Are Updated

To ensure thorough updates across all memory bank files:

1. **Use explicit language**: Always request "comprehensive" or "complete" updates
2. **List specific files**: Explicitly mention multiple files that should be updated
3. **Understand file interdependencies**: 
   - Character changes affect: character_profiles.md AND activeContext.md AND potentially worldContext.md
   - World elements affect: worldContext.md AND character_profiles.md AND narrativePatterns.md
   - Plot developments affect: master_outline.md AND character_profiles.md AND activeContext.md
4. **Request manifest**: Ask "What files need to be updated based on these changes?"
5. **Verify update breadth**: Review Cline's update summary to confirm multiple files were changed

## Files Cline MUST Check and Update

When performing comprehensive automatic updates, Cline should check ALL of these files:

1. **Core/activeContext.md**: ALWAYS updated with current work status and recent changes
2. **Core/worldContext.md**: Updated with any new worldbuilding elements and settings
3. **Core/narrativePatterns.md**: Updated with any new storytelling patterns observed
4. **Characters/character_profiles.md**: Updated with ANY character development or mentions
5. **Plot/master_outline.md**: Refined based on actual writing and plot revelations
6. **Core/progress.md**: Updated with completion status and project insights
7. **Core/storyContext.md**: Updated if themes or purpose elements change

## Beyond Basic Updates

For more comprehensive memory management, ask Cline to:

1. **Use the update checklist**: "Please go through the comprehensive update checklist in your instructions"
2. **Perform interdependent updates**: "Update character_profiles.md AND update how these character changes affect worldContext.md AND master_outline.md"
3. **Find cross-file inconsistencies**: "Check if there are any contradictions between ALL memory bank files after these updates"
4. **Request explicit chain updates**: "After updating character_profiles.md, please check and update ALL related sections in other files"

## Specific Prompts for Thorough Updates

```
We've established important details about [character]. Please:
1. Update character_profiles.md with their new traits, goals, and relationships

4. Update narrativePatterns.md if this character embodies themes
5. ALWAYS update activeContext.md with the current character status
```

### For world-building updates:

1. Update worldContext.md with all details about [element]
2. Update character_profiles.md to reflect how characters interact with this element
3. Update master_outline.md to show how this element affects the plot
4. Update narrativePatterns.md with thematic implications
