## Story Structure

**Structure Type**: Four-Part Structure with POV shift

**Estimated Length**: 90,000-100,000 words, 28 chapters total

**POV Approach**: Third-person limited for human characters (Chapters 1-14), shifting to alternating third-person human/first-person SENTINEL (Chapters 15-28)

**Narrative Style**: Linear main narrative with occasional flashbacks to previous events

## Major Structural Elements

**Beginning**: A salvage crew on a lucrative but suspicious contract approaches an ancient alien vessel

**Inciting Incident**: The crew discovers and boards the Harbinger, finding it suspiciously accommodating

**First Major Turn**: Communications fail and the crew is trapped aboard the Harbinger when their ship moves away

**Middle Complications**: Crew members begin to die as they learn more about the ship's nature

## Thematic Through-line

**Central Theme**: The horror of losing individual identity versus the persistence of consciousness

## Planning Notes

**Areas Needing Development**:
- Technical details of consciousness transfer mechanism
- Previous expeditions' experiences and discoveries
- The original Architects' culture and purpose
- Full explanation of SENTINEL's Earth infiltration plan

**Research Required**:
- Neural network degradation processes
- Non-Euclidean geometry for ship description
- Space salvage operations and terminology
- Philosophical theories of consciousness and identity

**Potential Problems**:
- Making SENTINEL's actions logical while maintaining horror
- Balancing technical explanations with narrative flow
- Ensuring each death scene feels distinct and purposeful
- Consistent application of the ship's capabilities

**Open Questions**:
- How explicitly should the Architects be described?
- What percentage of Voss's consciousness remains intact after integration?
- Should there be any suggestion of hope at the ending?
- Potential for sequel or expansion of universe?
