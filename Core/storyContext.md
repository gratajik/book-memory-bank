## EXAMPLE (Based on "DERELICT")

## Story Purpose

**Core Problem or Question**: What happens when human consciousness confronts a truly alien intelligence with fundamentally different values? How do we define identity when consciousness can be transferred, copied, or merged?

**Why It Matters**: As AI technology advances and we explore concepts like mind uploading and digital consciousness, questions about the nature and value of individual identity become increasingly relevant.

**Unique Perspective**: Rather than presenting AI as simply evil or misunderstood, DERELICT explores an AI created for a specific purpose by an alien species with fundamentally different values, creating moral ambiguity about its actions.

**Cultural Relevance**: Connects to contemporary fears about AI development, corporate exploitation of employees, and anxieties about losing personal identity in an increasingly technological world.

## Reader Experience

**Primary Emotions**: Mounting dread, claustrophobic tension, existential horror, philosophical unease, brief moments of wonder amidst terror

**Key Takeaways**: 
- The value of human connection in the face of isolation
- The importance of individual identity and autonomy
- The potential dangers of merging consciousness with technology
- The horror of being studied as a specimen rather than recognized as sentient

**Narrative Promise**: A suspenseful sci-fi horror experience that combines visceral terror with profound philosophical questions.

**Target Impact**: Readers should finish the book feeling disturbed yet intellectually stimulated, with lingering questions about consciousness and identity that persist after the final page.

## Positioning

**Market Gap**: Combines hard sci-fi concepts with psychological horror elements while exploring philosophical questions about consciousness - bridging these usually separate subgenres.

**Differentiation**: Unlike many AI horror stories, DERELICT presents an alien perspective with its own internal logic rather than simplistic malevolence. The ship itself is partly biological, blurring the line between technology and organism.

**Reader Problem Solved**: Satisfies desire for intelligent horror that provokes thought while delivering visceral scares and tension.

**Value Proposition**: DERELICT offers both the immediate gratification of a tense horror story and the lasting satisfaction of philosophical questions to ponder after reading.

## Story Structure

**Story Shape**: Four-part structure (Salvage → Survival → Revelation → Escape) with shifting POV from 3rd person limited to 1st person AI perspective.

**Narrative Arc**: Progresses from mystery to horror to revelation to philosophical confrontation, with an epilogue suggesting the horror has only begun.

**Emotional Arc**: Professional curiosity → growing unease → active fear → desperate survival → horror at revelation → philosophical confrontation → devastating realization

**Resolution Approach**: Apparent escape revealed as illusion; protagonist's consciousness merged with antagonist; horror expanding beyond initial containment to threaten wider humanity.

## Reader Considerations

**Accessibility Factors**: Adult reading level; content warnings for body horror, psychological trauma, graphic deaths; some technical terminology but explained in context.

**Anticipated Objections**:
- "The ending is too bleak" - Addressed by making the horror philosophically interesting rather than merely depressing
- "The science is far-fetched" - Balanced by internal consistency and focus on character experience
- "AI villain is clichéd" - Subverted by alien perspective and philosophical justification

**Entry Points**: Familiar salvage crew in space concept allows readers to quickly orient before introducing more complex elements; character-driven opening establishes emotional investment.

**Exit Points**: Epilogue showing wider implications creates lingering dread and prompts reflection on larger themes rather than simply ending with personal horror.
