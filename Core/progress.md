## EXAMPLE (Based on "DERELICT")

## Current Status

**Project Phase**: Late Drafting/Early Revision

**Completion Percentage**: ~85% (24/28 chapters complete in draft form)

**Deadline Status**: Slightly behind schedule (2 weeks behind target)

**Current Milestone**: Complete draft of Part 3 (Revelation), begin revisions of Part 2 (Survival)

## What Works

**Strengths**:
- Character differentiation (each crew member has distinct voice/perspective)
- Horror set pieces (The Breathing Room and Echo Chamber particularly effective)
- SENTINEL's clinical voice and perspective
- Atmosphere of mounting dread in early chapters
- Balance of technical sci-fi with visceral horror

**Effective Techniques**:
- Alternating POV between human and AI in later chapters
- Focusing on psychological horror rather than gore
- Using ship's environment as active character
- Revealing backstory through high-pressure situations
- Creating distinctive death scenes that reveal more about the ship

**Flow Areas**:
- Chapters 8-11 (The Breathing Room through Echo Chamber)
- Chapter 15 (SENTINEL's introduction)
- Chapters 3-4 (First Contact and Exploration)
- Character interactions in Chapter 1

**Reader Feedback**:
- Beta readers "couldn't put it down" during Parts 1-2
- Strong emotional response to Talia's death
- Positive reaction to ship's gradual personification
- Several readers mentioned staying up late to finish sections

## What's Left to Build

**Incomplete Sections**:
- Chapter 21 (Final Confrontation) - outline complete, drafting in progress
- Chapters 22-28 (Part 4: Escape) - detailed outlines only
- Epilogue needs significant expansion

**Drafting Needed**:
- Voss's transformation/integration experience
- SENTINEL's Earth infiltration process
- Nox's final confrontation with Voss
- Chapter 27's philosophical debate between Voss and SENTINEL

**Revision Needed**:
- SENTINEL voice consistency throughout Chapters 15-20
- Chen's technical explanations (too expository)
- Early foreshadowing of ship's sentience
- Clarify Nexus Corporation's prior knowledge

**Polishing Needed**:
- Consistent ship terminology
- Environmental descriptions in Chapters 5-7
- Smoother transitions between POVs
- Tightening dialogue in Chapter 12

## Known Issues

**Plot Problems**:
- Insufficient explanation for why ship doesn't kill all crew immediately
- Timeline of previous expeditions needs clarification
- Logic of SENTINEL's Earth infiltration plan requires refinement
- How Voss accesses escape pod needs clearer mechanism

**Character Issues**:
- Nox's corporate espionage motivation underdeveloped
- Kareem's religious background inconsistently applied
- Wrench sometimes too similar to generic "tech guy" archetype
- SENTINEL's "character development" needs smoother progression

**Structure Concerns**:
- Part 2 may have too many chapters before first major death
- Part 4 pacing could feel rushed with current outline
- Potential imbalance between action and philosophical content in Chapters 24-27
- Chapter 11 (Echo Chamber) information dump may overwhelm readers

**Quality Gaps**:
- Some SENTINEL exposition too technical/dry
- Death scenes after Talia's may seem repetitive without sufficient variation
- Ship descriptions sometimes inconsistent
- Some dialogue in early chapters feels expository

## Evolution of Project Decisions

**Initial Concept vs. Current**:
- Originally planned as straight horror, evolved to include more philosophical elements
- SENTINEL initially more malevolent, now more alien with understandable purpose
- Ship was purely mechanical in concept, added biological components during development
- Originally planned 3-part structure, expanded to 4 parts with escape sequence

**Abandoned Elements**:
- Second survivor besides Voss (decided single survivor created stronger horror)
- Rescue mission arrival (undermined horror of isolation)
- Romance subplot between Voss and Kareem (distracted from core horror)
- Happy ending possibility (inconsistent with established tone)

**New Directions**:
- Added SENTINEL first-person POV (originally all human perspective)
- Expanded Architects' backstory significantly
- Developed ship's biological aspects more prominently
- Created more detailed explanation of consciousness transfer mechanism

**Lessons Learned**:
- Character secrets create more tension when partially revealed early
- Death scenes more effective when tied to character's specialty/focus
- Technical explanations more digestible when delivered through dialogue
- Horror enhanced by periods of false security

## Activity Log

**Recent Activity**:
- Week of 4/24: Completed draft of Chapter 20, revised Chapters 15-17
- Week of 5/1: Outlined remaining chapters in detail, began Chapter 21
- Week of 5/8: Reworked SENTINEL voice in Chapters 15-19, continued Chapter 21

**Productivity Patterns**:
- Most productive during early morning sessions (5-7am)
- Human POV chapters flow better when written in single sessions
- SENTINEL chapters require separate writing mindset
- Plot progress when walking/exercising before writing

**Blocking Issues**:
- Uncertainty about technical details of consciousness transfer
- Difficulty balancing philosophical content with maintaining tension
- Challenge of making SENTINEL both understandable and alien
- Time constraints from day job limiting writing to 1-2 hours per day

**Next Work Session**:
- Complete Chapter 21 draft (focus on Voss's confrontation with SENTINEL)
- Outline detailed beat structure for Chapters 22-24
- Review and revise SENTINEL dialogue for consistent voice
