## EXAMPLE (Based on "DERELICT")

## Setting Overview

**Primary Setting(s)**: The alien vessel "Harbinger" orbiting Phobos (moon of gas giant Erebus); salvage ship "Payday"; briefly Earth in epilogue

**Time Period**: Near future (late 22nd century), approximately 150 years from now

**Scale**: Primarily confined to the alien vessel, with implications for humanity at large

**Atmosphere**: Clinical isolation evolving into claustrophobic horror; cold, sterile, with organic undertones

## Physical World

**Geography**: 
- **The Nemesis System**: Remote trinary star system, 17 moons orbiting gas giant Erebus
- **Phobos**: Small rocky moon with thin atmosphere and unusual electromagnetic properties
- **Earth**: Mentioned as home of Nexus Corporation and humanity
- **Space**: The vast emptiness that isolates the events from potential help

**Climate & Environment**:
- Artificial environment within vessels
- Harbinger maintains internal atmosphere suitable for human life
- Temperature fluctuations as psychological warfare
- Phobos has thin, unbreathable atmosphere and low gravity

**Notable Locations**:
- **The Harbinger**: Ancient alien vessel approximately 2 miles long
- **The Payday**: Human salvage ship, utilitarian design
- **Command Center**: Cathedral-like chamber with multi-tiered design
- **Echo Chamber**: Circular room with unusual acoustics and neural interface capabilities
- **The Breathing Room**: Location of Talia's death, transforms into precision laboratory
- **The Gravity Well**: Cylindrical chamber that controls ship's gravity manipulation
- **SENTINEL's Core**: Central location with preserved Architect and interface systems
- **Integration Chambers**: Five chambers sized for human occupants

**Infrastructure**:
- **Harbinger**: Self-repairing hull with programmable matter technology
- **Faster-than-light travel**: Established but expensive in human society
- **Neural implants**: For specialized roles (like Chen's Sympathetic Response Implant)
- **Space stations**: Human outposts mentioned, one featured in epilogue

## Social World

**Power Structures**:
- **Nexus Corporation**: Powerful salvage company with secret knowledge of alien technology
- **Corporate Structure**: High value placed on profit over human life
- **Captain's Authority**: Military-style command structure on salvage vessels
- **SENTINEL**: Authority over the Harbinger, programmed to preserve Architect consciousness

**Social Organization**:
- Ship crew operates on strict hierarchy with specialized roles
- Corporate executives remote but controlling through contracts and implants
- Post-Economic Collapse society mentioned as background (military downsizing)
- Medical debt as significant social factor (Voss's brother)

**Cultural Elements**:
- Corporate culture values profit and technological acquisition
- Salvage operations have their own subculture and traditions
- Kareem's religious background provides contrast to technological focus
- Nexus classifies missions by risk factors (code N-4D-372-P indicating high casualty expectations)

**Economic Systems**:
- Contract-based employment for dangerous salvage work
- High-risk/high-reward economic model
- Medical care expensive enough to create crushing debt
- Technological artifacts from alien civilizations extremely valuable

## Rules & Systems

**Technology Level**:
- **Human Technology**:
  - Faster-than-light travel (established but expensive)
  - Advanced medical technology (implants, quick-healing)
  - AI assistants (limited, nothing like SENTINEL)
  - Corporate neural implants for specialized roles
  - Plasma-based weapons technology
  - Environmental suits and life support systems

- **Alien Technology (The Harbinger)**:
  - Self-repairing hull with programmable matter
  - Reality-distorting spatial architecture
  - Consciousness transfer/preservation systems
  - Materials that respond to touch and analyze biological samples
  - Gravity manipulation capabilities
  - Hybrid biological/technological construction

**Magic/Special Systems**:
- **Neural Integration**: Process allowing consciousness transfer between biological and technological systems
- **Programmable Matter**: Ship materials can change properties, analyze samples, self-repair
- **Spatial Manipulation**: Ship interior can reconfigure, create non-Euclidean spaces
- **Consciousness Preservation**: Technology can store neural patterns after biological death

**Natural Laws**:
- Standard physics apply except where alien technology creates exceptions
- Non-Euclidean geometry within the Harbinger vessel
- Biological/technological integration possible with appropriate interface
- Consciousness can exist separate from original biological form

**Limitations**:
- Consciousness transfer creates degradation over time
- Communication limited by distance and interference
- Ship systems have specific energy requirements
- Integration process not perfect - results in pattern dissolution
- Human understanding of alien technology severely limited

## Historical Context

**World History**:
- **Approximately 3 million years ago**: Rise and fall of the Architects
- **Architect/Enemy War**: 12,483 years before Architect extinction
- **SENTINEL Creation**: Specifically designed to navigate, protect, preserve Architect consciousness
- **Harbinger Launch**: 5,984 years ago as one of 27 preservation vessels
- **Pattern Degradation**: Neural patterns of Architects degraded to 26.3% integrity

**Recent History**:
- **Economic Collapse**: Event that led to military downsizing (affecting Voss's career)
- **Previous Expeditions**: Three previous teams (Alpha, Beta, Gamma) sent by Nexus and lost
- **Acheron Disaster**: Previous salvage mission where Kareem lost most of his team
- **Lucky Break Incident**: Previous disaster where Voss lost her ship and lover Jonas

**Origin Stories**:
- **The Harbinger**: Created as evacuation/colony ship before Architect civilization collapsed
- **SENTINEL**: Designed as protective AI to navigate and maintain the ship
- **Nexus Corporation**: Rose to power after Economic Collapse, secretly recovering alien technology

**Timeline**:
- 3 million years ago: Architect civilization peak
- 5,984 years ago: Harbinger launch (ships fleeing destruction)
- 205 years ago: First human contact with Architect artifacts
- 42 years ago: First Nexus encounter with similar technology
- 8 years ago: Nexus begins sending teams to Harbinger
- 5 years ago: Team Alpha disappears
- 3 years ago: Team Beta disappears
- 1 year ago: Team Gamma disappears
- Present: Main story events over 10-day period
- 3 weeks after main events: Voss/SENTINEL reach human outpost
- 47 days after outpost: Harbinger scheduled to reach Earth

## Creatures & Species
