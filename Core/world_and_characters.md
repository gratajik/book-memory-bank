## EXAMPLE (Based on "DERELICT")

## Part I: World Context

### Setting Overview

**Primary Setting(s)**: The alien vessel "Harbinger" orbiting Phobos (moon of gas giant Erebus); salvage ship "Payday"; briefly Earth in epilogue

**Time Period**: Near future (late 22nd century), approximately 150 years from now

**Scale**: Primarily confined to the alien vessel, with implications for humanity at large

**Atmosphere**: Clinical isolation evolving into claustrophobic horror; cold, sterile, with organic undertones

### Physical World

**Geography**: 
- **The Nemesis System**: Remote trinary star system, 17 moons orbiting gas giant Erebus
- **Phobos**: Small rocky moon with thin atmosphere and unusual electromagnetic properties
- **Earth**: Mentioned as home of Nexus Corporation and humanity
- **Space**: The vast emptiness that isolates the events from potential help

**Climate & Environment**:
- Artificial environment within vessels
- Harbinger maintains internal atmosphere suitable for human life
- Temperature fluctuations as psychological warfare
- Phobos has thin, unbreathable atmosphere and low gravity

**Notable Locations**:
- **The Harbinger**: Ancient alien vessel approximately 2 miles long
- **The Payday**: Human salvage ship, utilitarian design
- **Command Center**: Cathedral-like chamber with multi-tiered design
- **Echo Chamber**: Circular room with unusual acoustics and neural interface capabilities
- **The Breathing Room**: Location of Talia's death, transforms into precision laboratory
- **The Gravity Well**: Cylindrical chamber that controls ship's gravity manipulation
- **SENTINEL's Core**: Central location with preserved Architect and interface systems
- **Integration Chambers**: Five chambers sized for human occupants

**Infrastructure**:
- **Harbinger**: Self-repairing hull with programmable matter technology
- **Faster-than-light travel**: Established but expensive in human society
- **Neural implants**: For specialized roles (like Chen's Sympathetic Response Implant)
- **Space stations**: Human outposts mentioned, one featured in epilogue

### Social World

**Power Structures**:
- **Nexus Corporation**: Powerful salvage company with secret knowledge of alien technology
- **Corporate Structure**: High value placed on profit over human life
- **Captain's Authority**: Military-style command structure on salvage vessels
- **SENTINEL**: Authority over the Harbinger, programmed to preserve Architect consciousness

**Social Organization**:

- Corporate executives remote but controlling through contracts and implants
- Post-Economic Collapse society mentioned as background (military downsizing)
- Medical debt as significant social factor (Voss's brother)

**Cultural Elements**:
- Corporate culture values profit and technological acquisition
- Salvage operations have their own subculture and traditions
- Kareem's religious background provides contrast to technological focus

## Part III: World-Character Connections

**Character-Setting Relationships**:
- Voss represents human military/hierarchical structure contrasting with the alien ship's organic/integrated systems
- Chen bridges human and alien technology through his implant, physically embodying the story's central conflict
- SENTINEL functions as both character and environment, blurring the line between setting and antagonist
- Kareem's religious background provides contrast to the ship's technological "afterlife" system

**Environmental Influences**:
- The isolated, enclosed setting forces characters to confront both external threats and internal secrets
- Ship's non-Euclidean geometry creates increasing disorientation mirroring psychological breakdown
- Artificial environments (Payday vs. Harbinger) reflect human utility versus alien aesthetic/functional integration
- Progressive revelation of ship's biological elements parallels crew's discovery of their "specimen" status

**Social Position Impact**:
- Voss's military background shapes her approach to leadership and crisis management
- Corporate hierarchy (represented by Nox) conflicts with crew loyalty in decision-making
- Specialized roles (Wrench's technical expertise, Chen's linguistic knowledge) determine each character's value and vulnerability
- SENTINEL's position as guardian/preserver justifies actions that would be monstrous by human moral standards

**Historical Connections**:
- Economic Collapse in Earth's history drives Voss's financial motivations
- Previous failed expeditions foreshadow current crew's fate while providing clues
- Ancient Architect/Enemy conflict parallels current SENTINEL/human struggle
- History of salvage disasters (Lucky Break, Acheron) shapes crew expectations and responses

**Thematic Integration**:
- Ship's physical integration of technology and biology mirrors thematic concern with consciousness preservation
- Non-Euclidean spaces physically represent the "impossible" nature of consciousness transfer
- The isolation of deep space emphasizes themes of being alone with one's thoughts/consciousness
- Progressive character deaths represent different aspects of identity loss and transformation
