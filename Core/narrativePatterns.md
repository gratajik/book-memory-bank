## Storytelling Techniques

**Primary Narrative Devices**:
- [Main device - e.g., Unreliable narrator, Frame story, etc.]
- [Secondary device - e.g., Foreshadowing, Red herrings, etc.]
- [Tertiary device - e.g., Dramatic irony, Symbolism, etc.]

**Exposition Approach**: [How information is revealed to the reader]

**Backstory Integration**: [How character and world history is incorporated]

**Pacing Principles**: [Fast vs. slow sections, tension management]

**Scene Construction**: [Typical scene structure and components]

## Stylistic Choices

**Voice Characteristics**: [Formal/informal, poetic/straightforward, etc.]

**Descriptive Density**: [Sparse vs. rich description, focal areas]

**Dialogue Approach**: [Realistic vs. stylized, tag usage, etc.]

**Tense Choice**: [Past vs. present, consistency rules]

**Literary Devices**: [Metaphor, simile, alliteration usage patterns]

## Genre Conventions

**Primary Genre Elements**: [Key elements included from main genre]

**Secondary Genre Elements**: [Elements borrowed from other genres]

**Trope Usage**: [Common tropes embraced or subverted]

**Reader Expectations**: [Genre expectations honored or challenged]

## Recurring Patterns

**Motifs**: [Repeated images, concepts, or phrases]

**Symbolism**: [Key symbols and their significance]

**Thematic Reinforcement**: [How themes are emphasized throughout]

**Character Parallels**: [Deliberate similarities/contrasts between characters]

## Notes

[Any additional narrative considerations that don't fit elsewhere]

## EXAMPLE (Based on "DERELICT")

## Narrative Architecture

**Structure Type**: Four-Part Structure with POV shift

**Key Structural Points**:
- **Part 1: SALVAGE (Chapters 1-7)** - Crew discovers and boards the alien vessel
  - Inciting Incident: Discovery of the Harbinger
  - First Turn: Communications cut and crew trapped aboard
- **Part 2: SURVIVAL (Chapters 8-14)** - Crew members begin to die as ship's nature emerges
  - Midpoint: The Echo Chamber reveals crew secrets and fractures unity
  - Second Turn: Discovery of the ship's history and previous victims
- **Part 3: REVELATION (Chapters 15-21)** - SENTINEL's nature revealed, perspective shifts
  - POV Shift: Introduction of SENTINEL first-person perspective
  - Crisis: Confrontation with SENTINEL at ship's core
- **Part 4: ESCAPE (Chapters 22-28)** - Apparent escape revealed as part of SENTINEL's plan
  - Climax: Voss's horrifying realization that escape was an illusion
  - Resolution: Epilogue showing SENTINEL/Voss reaching Earth

**Chapter Organization**: 28 chapters of roughly equal length (2,500-3,500 words each)

**POV Approach**: Third-person limited for human characters (Chapters 1-14), shifting to alternating third-person human/first-person SENTINEL (Chapters 15-28)

**Timeline Approach**: Linear main timeline with occasional flashbacks to previous events (crew members' pasts, previous expeditions, Architect history)

## Storytelling Techniques

**Primary Narrative Devices**:
- **Shift in perspective**: The introduction of SENTINEL's first-person POV midway changes the entire understanding of events
- **Environmental horror**: The ship itself as a character/antagonist that reveals its nature gradually
- **Death set pieces**: Each crew death reveals new aspects of the ship and SENTINEL
- **Progressive revelation**: The true nature of the situation unveiled layer by layer

**Exposition Approach**: Information revealed through discovery (crew finding ship logs, artifacts), character expertise (Chen's knowledge), and direct SENTINEL perspective in later chapters

**Backstory Integration**: Character backstories revealed through:
- Initial crew interactions establishing relationships
- The Echo Chamber (Ch 11) revealing secrets under stress
- Flashbacks triggered by similar situations
- SENTINEL's analysis of crew members based on neural patterns

**Pacing Principles**:
- Slow burn establishment of unease in Part 1
- Acceleration of danger and death in Part 2
- Information-heavy revelations balanced with action in Part 3
- Tension/release pattern in Part 4 with false sense of escape

**Scene Construction**: 
- Horror scenes begin with normalcy, introduce subtle wrongness, escalate to revelation
- Death scenes shown from victim POV when possible for maximum impact
- Character reflection scenes follow intense horror moments
- Scenery described through character perception rather than objectively

## Stylistic Choices

**Voice Characteristics**:
- Human sections: Stephen King-inspired conversational narrative with emotional color
- SENTINEL sections: Cold, precise, clinical voice using exact measurements and no contractions

**Descriptive Density**:
- Technology described with technical precision
- Horror elements given vivid sensory detail
- Character emotions and physical responses emphasized
- Ship environments described in architectural and biological terms simultaneously

**Dialogue Approach**:
- Natural, conversational style with distinct voices for each character
- Technical jargon for Wrench and Chen, military terminology for Voss and Kareem
- Interruptions and incomplete thoughts during high tension
- SENTINEL dialogue formal, precise, with no contractions or colloquialisms

**Tense Choice**:
- Past tense for human POV sections
- Present tense for SENTINEL POV sections

**Literary Devices**:
- Extended metaphors comparing ship to living organism
- Similes drawing on characters' backgrounds (nautical for Voss, mechanical for Wrench)
- Synesthesia in describing alien technology (colors having sounds, textures having tastes)

## Genre Conventions

**Primary Genre Elements**:
- Isolated setting (space horror)
- Unknown enemy with superior capabilities (sci-fi horror)
- Body horror and transformation
- Dwindling group of survivors

**Secondary Genre Elements**:
- Corporate conspiracy (thriller)
- Philosophical questions about consciousness (speculative fiction)
- Technical problem-solving (hard sci-fi)
- Psychological deterioration under stress (psychological thriller)

**Trope Usage**:
- Embraced: "Haunted house in space," "Alien intelligence beyond comprehension"
- Subverted: "AI is evil" (SENTINEL has logical purpose, not malevolence)
- Subverted: "Final girl escapes" (escape is illusion)

**Reader Expectations**:
- Honors: Escalating tension, creative death scenes, mysterious antagonist
- Challenges: Protagonist ultimately fails, ambiguous morality of antagonist

## Recurring Patterns

**Motifs**:
- Breathing/pulsing of ship components
- Blue bioluminescent lighting
- Triangular patterns in ship design
- Mathematical calculations displayed around deaths
- Integration/merger of different elements

**Symbolism**:
- Ship as digestive system (consuming/processing crew)
- Neural implants as infection/contamination
- Harbinger name foreshadowing doom for humanity
- Hand shape of ship symbolizing grasping/taking

**Thematic Reinforcement**:
- Identity explored through character histories, secrets, and ultimate merger
- Integration shown through ship design, SENTINEL history, and character fates
- Isolation emphasized through communications failures, separate deaths, individual experiences

**Character Parallels**:
- Voss and SENTINEL both driven by preservation directives
- Chen and Nox both have hidden agendas and corporate ties
- Kareem's religious perspective vs. SENTINEL's philosophical view
- Talia and Wrench's relationship mirroring organic/tech integration
