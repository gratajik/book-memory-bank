## Notes

ALWAYS write like a human author would, unless specially told something different for a character

- Loosen the formality
- Use contractions, broken sentences, and informal rhythm.
- Avoid perfectly modulated speeches—let characters interrupt, pause, react.
- Add emotional color and subtext
- Let characters show nervousness, ambition, impatience, pride, or doubt.
- Replace clinical terms with vivid, sensory descriptions where possible.
- Emphasize personal experience over institutional grandeur
- Highlight how a character feels in the moment (e.g., heat of the room, tension in the air).
- Focus on small human cues: a clenched jaw, a hesitation, a flicker of surprise.
- Use similes, metaphors, and humor sparingly but effectively
- Sparingly Insert grounded comparisons (e.g., “like a kid waiting for test results,” or “the air tasted like static before a storm”).
- Let dialogue reflect personality and power dynamic shifts
