## EXAMPLE (Based on "DERELICT")

## Voice & Tone

**Narrative Voice**: Shifting dual approach:
- Human sections: Stephen King-inspired conversational narrative with emotional color
- SENTINEL sections: Cold, precise, clinical voice using exact measurements and no contractions

**Tone**: Predominantly dark, growing increasingly clinical/detached in SENTINEL sections

**Emotional Range**: Full range for human characters (fear predominant), extremely limited for SENTINEL (curiosity, scientific interest, occasional contempt)

**Reader Relationship**: No direct reader address; immersive experience through limited POV

## Point of View

**Primary POV**: 
- Chapters 1-14: Third-person limited focusing on human characters
- Chapters 15-28: Alternating between third-person limited (humans) and first-person (SENTINEL)

**POV Shifts**: 
- Always clearly marked by chapter or section breaks
- No head-hopping within scenes
- First SENTINEL POV clearly designated with voice shift

**Interior Thoughts**: 
- Human thoughts in italics when direct quotes
- Thoughts generally blended into narration through free indirect discourse
- SENTINEL's entire first-person sections function as interior thoughts

**Knowledge Limitations**:
- Human POV limited to what character perceives
- SENTINEL POV has access to ship systems and partial access to human neural patterns
- Neither POV is omniscient

## Language Choices

**Vocabulary Level**: 
- Mixed technical/scientific terminology with accessible narrative
- Technical density increases in SENTINEL sections
- Human sections use more emotional, sensory language
- SENTINEL uses precise measurements (e.g., "26.3% pattern integrity" not "about 26%")

**Sentence Structure**: 
- Human sections: Varied length, fragments during action/tension
- SENTINEL sections: More formal, complex sentence structures with precise qualifiers
- Short sentences for emphasis in both

**Paragraph Length**: 
- Generally short to medium (3-5 sentences)
- Single sentence paragraphs for emphasis
- SENTINEL analysis sections can run longer

**Dialect and Speech Patterns**: 
- Technical jargon for Wrench and Chen
- Military terminology for Voss and Kareem
- Corporate speak for Nox
- Clinical precision for SENTINEL

## Dialogue

**Dialogue Tags**: 
- Primarily "said" and "asked" with occasional descriptive verbs when relevant
- Action beats often used instead of tags
- SENTINEL speech always "stated" or equivalent formal verb

**Action Beats**: 
- Used frequently to show character state and environment
- Generally short and tied to emotional state
- Often used to replace dialogue tags

**Internal Dialogue**: 
- Italics for direct thought quotes
- Regular text for free indirect discourse
- SENTINEL's entire POV functions as internal dialogue

**Dialect and Accents**: 
- Minimal use of phonetic spelling for accents
- Character voice conveyed through word choice and sentence structure
- SENTINEL uses no contractions and precise percentages

## Grammar & Mechanics

**Tense**: 
- Human sections: Past tense
- SENTINEL sections: Present tense
- Consistent within each POV

**Punctuation Preferences**: 
- Oxford comma used consistently
- Em dashes for interrupted speech or sudden transitions
- Semicolons used sparingly
- Ellipses for trailing thoughts or hesitation

**Capitalization**: 
- SENTINEL always all caps
- Ship name "Harbinger" italicized and capitalized
- "Architects" capitalized as species name
- Technical terms in lowercase unless proper nouns

**Numbers**: 
- Numbers under 100 spelled out in human sections
- Precise numerals (including decimals) in SENTINEL sections
- Percentages always as numerals with % symbol

## Formatting

**Chapter Headers**: 
- Chapter number and title centered (e.g., "Chapter 15: The Intelligence")
- Extra space before first paragraph
- No direct indicators of POV shift beyond content

**Scene Breaks**: 
- Three centered asterisks (* * *)
- Used for significant time jumps or POV shifts within chapters

**Emphasis**: 
- Italics for emphasis, thoughts, ship names
- Bold not used in manuscript
- ALL CAPS used very sparingly for extreme emphasis

**Special Text**: 
- Ship computer messages in monospace font
- Written notes from previous expeditions in italics
- SENTINEL's calculations in structured lists

## Genre-Specific Conventions

**Setting Descriptions**: 
- Heavy emphasis on sensory details, especially touch and sound
- Environmental descriptions focus on wrongness/alienness
- Ship described in both mechanical and biological terms
- Space and scale used to create isolation

**Action Scenes**: 
- Quick, short sentences
- Visceral sensory details
- Focus on character perception rather than objective events
- Time dilation during high stress

**Emotional Scenes**: 
- Physical manifestations of emotion (racing heart, clenched jaw)
- Environmental reflections of emotional state
- Contrast between exterior calm and interior turmoil for Voss
- Absence of emotion in SENTINEL creates dissonance

**Exposition**: 
- Technical explanations primarily through dialogue
- Ship history revealed through discovered artifacts/logs
- SENTINEL sections can contain more direct exposition
- Character backstory revealed through pressure situations

## Character-Specific Elements

**Character Voice Consistency**: 
- Voss: Economical, military terminology, short sentences under stress
- Chen: Academic vocabulary, trailing off when distracted
- Wrench: Colorful metaphors with technical jargon
- Nox: Corporate speak shifting to calculation
- Kareem: Hyperawareness descriptions, military/spiritual references
- Talia: Navigational references, youthful optimism fighting dread
- SENTINEL: Clinical, precise measurements, no contractions, occasional contempt

**Character-Specific Terms**: 
- Voss: Naval/military analogies
- Chen: Scientific terminology, anatomical references
- Wrench: Engineering slang, mechanical comparisons
- SENTINEL: "Subject: [designation]" for humans, "pattern integrity," "integration"

**Name Usage**: 
- Crew members use last names in professional contexts, first names in personal
- Voss refers to all by last names except in emotional moments
- SENTINEL refers to humans by function first, then "Subject: [Designation]"

**Thought Patterns**: 
- Voss thinks in tactical assessments and crew welfare
- Chen's thoughts are analytical and self-preserving
- Kareem's thoughts focus on threat detection and assessment
- SENTINEL thinks in percentages, experimental outcomes, and analysis

## World-Specific Elements

**Terminology**: 
- "Pattern integrity" - measure of consciousness preservation quality
- "Integration" - process of absorbing consciousness into ship systems
- "The Breathing Room" - chamber where Talia dies
- "Echo Chamber" - room that reveals crew secrets
- "Mirror Protocol" - duplication process for study

**Made-up Words**: 
- Architect terms italicized when first introduced
- SENTINEL's designations in quotation marks first time, then plain text

**Technology/Magic**: 
- Ship technology described in both mechanical and biological terms
- Neural interfaces described through user experience first, then mechanics
- Consciousness transfer described through synesthetic language
- Non-Euclidean spaces described through character disorientation

**Cultural References**: 
- Earth references familiar to contemporary readers
- Future development explained through character knowledge
- Alien cultural elements viewed through human perception
- Minimal direct exposition on future human society

## Problem Areas to Watch

**Crutch Words**: 
- "Suddenly" - replace with direct action
- "Felt" - replace with specific physical sensation
- "Very/really" - replace with specific intensifier or cut
- "Just" - usually unnecessary

**Passive Voice**: 
- Avoid in action sequences
- Acceptable in SENTINEL sections for clinical distance
- Occasional use for emphasis or when agent is unknown

**Telling vs. Showing**: 
- Show emotional states through physical reactions
- Show ship's nature through its actions rather than explanation
- SENTINEL sections can contain more telling (fits character)
- Show relationships through interactions, not statements

**Info Dumps**: 
- Break technical explanations into dialogue exchanges
- Reveal ship history through discovered artifacts/logs
- Space out revelations about previous expeditions
- Use SENTINEL sections for necessary exposition that fits character
